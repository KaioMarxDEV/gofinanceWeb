## Learn More

This project tends to be a useful website for personal managment of finance data, inspired by a video from [Pirate King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arxoYcRWeM) but with a touch of my
technical and architectural believes, written in the best/beast GO language.

Going against the community's standard framework (gin), I decided to implement a REST API using the safest and most performant framework of all popular web languages, and luckily that framework is written in Go (huff is not JavaScript)
so I built the application described in the video, but thinking about the pillars of programming in Go, ending the project with a functional application with real cases and an easy-to-understand code, commented and standardized by google's style guides.

despite being inspired by someone else's work, all codes, ideas and standards are my responsibility and effort.
